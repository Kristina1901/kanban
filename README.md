# Task Management App

A task management application built using **Nuxt 3**, **Vue 3**, **Vuetify 3**, and **Pinia**. This app allows users to organize tasks into columns based on their status (e.g., TODO, In Progress, Done), drag and drop tasks between columns, and manage task details such as priority, assignees, and more.
